# Analyze A/B Test Results  

This project was completed as an assignment for Udacity's Data Analyst Program. 

For this project, I am working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to decide if the company should implement a new landing page or keep an old landing page in order to increase the number of users who "convert" or turn into paying customers. In order to analyze the data, I use bootstrapping to simulate sample populations and regression modeling.

The dataset used is contained in the 'ab_data.csv' file.
